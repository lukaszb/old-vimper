vimper
======

vimper is super simple set of vim plugins. It should work properly on both OSX
(preferably with macvim_) and Linux based systems.

Installation
------------

Simply clone vimper repository somewhere and run::

    $ python bootstrap.py

This would backup existing vim files installation and create links to the
vimper's repository.

Want an one liner?

    git clone git://github.com/lukaszb/vimper.git ~/.vimper && cd ~/.vimper && python bootstrap.py
